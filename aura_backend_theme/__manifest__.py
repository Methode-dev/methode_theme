            # ⚠ loading_style.js was REMOVED here in P8e, along with the file.
            # THEME_PLAN §13.5 planned to keep it and rebuild the six
            # .tbt-loading-style-* rule sets it depends on; P8e retired the six
            # styles instead, in favour of the single brand loader in
            # methode_theme/static/src/scss/loader.scss.  That left the script
            # writing two class families — tbt-loading-style-<name> and
            # tbt-loading-active — that nothing anywhere reads.
            #
            # It was not merely inert.  To maintain tbt-loading-active it ran a
            # MutationObserver over document.documentElement with subtree:true
            # AND attributes:true, so every DOM mutation in the SPA woke a
            # callback that did a querySelector + getComputedStyle, to set a
            # class with no consumer.  Deleting it is a performance fix as much
            # as a cleanup.
            #
            # --tbt-loading-style-dynamic is still injected by views/web_assets.xml
            # and tbt_loading_style still stores its column; both are harmless and
            # left alone so no migration is needed.
