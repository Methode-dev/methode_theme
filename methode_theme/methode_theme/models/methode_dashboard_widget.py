    ⚠ ondelete='cascade' on widget_type_id is a behaviour decision, not a default.
    §13.3 lists "graceful degradation" — Aura rendered a "no longer available"
    card when a widget's module had gone.  It had to: its layout rows stored a
    free-text widget id that could outlive the thing it named.  Here the row is a
    foreign key, so uninstalling an app takes its widget type AND every layout row
    pointing at it, and there is no dangling state left to degrade.  The
    unavailable card still earns its keep for the other half of §13.3 — a fetcher
    that errors at runtime — which P8b wires up.
