                ...
                return insights

    That is what replaces Aura's `_installed_modules()` scan: a signal exists
    exactly when the module contributing it is installed, and uninstalling takes
    the override with it.  Nothing here ever asks "is account installed?".

    Abstract because there is nothing to store — the banners are computed per
    request from live data plus the per-user dismissal map.
