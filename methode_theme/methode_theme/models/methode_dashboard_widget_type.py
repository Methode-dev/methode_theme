    """The dashboard's widget catalogue, as records.

    THEME_PLAN §13.7: "The widget catalogue is data, not a Python constant."
    Aura kept it as WIDGET_CATALOG, a 22-entry dict in a controller, gated at
    runtime by scanning installed modules.  Here each widget type is a record, so
    a module contributes a widget by shipping one — the way methode_apps_dropdown
    already declares methode.apps.category.

    ⚠ THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO `module_name` GATE, and adding one back would undo
    the point of the rewrite.  Aura needed it because every widget lived in one
    module whether or not its app was installed, so something had to hide them at
    runtime.  With records, presence IS the gate: an `account` widget ships from a
    bridge module that depends on `account` and auto-installs, so it exists
    exactly when the app does, and uninstalling the app removes the record with
    it.  A `module_name` string cannot do the second half — the rows would linger.

    ⚠ AND NO COLOUR FIELD.  Owner-decided in P8: Aura's catalogue carried seven
    colour tokens (brand/blue/orange/red/gray/green/purple) against a brand that
    is monochrome plus one orange accent (§13.2).  Identity is carried by the
    icon and by the material language; a widget type has no say in palette.
