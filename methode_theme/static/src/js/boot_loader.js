/**
 * Boot loader teardown (THEME_PLAN §13.5, P8e)
 *
 * views/boot_loader_templates.xml puts the Méthode mark in the body server-side,
 * so it paints before any JavaScript runs.  Nothing in that markup knows when the
 * wait is over, so this removes it once the webclient is actually mounted.
 *
 * ⚠ Removal is JS rather than a CSS state, and the node is DELETED rather than
 * hidden.  The mark is nineteen shapes on infinite animations; leaving it in the
 * DOM behind `display: none` would keep the whole set alive for the session.
 *
 * The signal is a main_components entry rather than a timer or a DOMContentLoaded
 * hook: those fire on a schedule that has nothing to do with whether the app is
 * ready, which is the one thing the loader is waiting for.  main_components are
 * rendered by the WebClient itself, so this onMounted IS "the webclient exists".
