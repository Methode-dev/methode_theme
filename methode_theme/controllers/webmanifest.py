    /web/manifest.webmanifest is generated in Python, not QWeb (see
    web/controllers/webmanifest.py), so it is the one icon surface
    views/favicon_templates.xml cannot reach.  Without this override an
    "Add to Home Screen" from the backend installs with Odoo's own purple
    icon while every browser tab shows the Méthode mark.

    ⚠ ONLY `icons` IS TOUCHED.  Stock also sets name (from the
    web.web_app_name config parameter), background_color and theme_color to
    Odoo's #714B67 — those are the splash screen and the mobile chrome, not
    the icon, and are left to whoever owns that decision.  The brand value
    for them would be $m-bg-primary / #FDFAF6 (static/src/scss/
    brand_variables.scss); the matching `<meta name="theme-color">` lives in
    web.webclient_bootstrap.
